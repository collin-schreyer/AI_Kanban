I'm building an AI Kanban board to track AI projects. I need you to generate realistic sub-tasks for the following project based on what has likely been completed and what remains.

do this for each of the projects you listed

Based on typical AI project development phases, generate 5-10 sub-tasks in this JSON format:

{

  "projectName": "[PROJECT NAME]",

  "subtasks": [

    {

      "name": "Short task name",

      "description": "Brief description of what this task involves",

      "status": "done|inprogress|todo",

      "assignee": "Collin",

      "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"

    }

  ]

}

Consider these typical AI project phases:

- Requirements gathering & stakeholder interviews

- Data assessment & collection

- Architecture design

- Proof of concept / prototype

- Model development & training

- Integration development

- Testing & validation

- Documentation

- Security review

- Deployment preparation

- User training / handoff

Make the subtasks specific to this project's domain. Mark early-phase tasks as "done", current work as "inprogress", and future work as "todo". Collin is the builder who does all implementation work.
